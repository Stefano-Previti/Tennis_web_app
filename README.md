**Tennis Web App**


The "TennisWebApp" project is a management application focused on the world of tennis. It guides the user through the entire lifespan of a tournament, starting from registration. The "player" user can sign up for local non-professional tournaments, organized by local court administrators, who will act as "admin" users. Each tournament will have 8 participants, and players will be updated in real-time about the tournament bracket and their progression through it. The admin (one per tournament) will be responsible for the draws (based on the points declared by players at registration) and for recording match outcomes, which will determine the quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. At the end of the tournament, both types of users will be presented with an option to start a new tournament.

In addition to managing and viewing the tournament bracket, all players will have access to equipment rental and review functions provided by the admin. The admin, in their profile, will have a feature to add equipment, including fields such as type, quantity, and description. Once added, they can check the status of the item to monitor available quantities and any reviews by players.

Players, on the other hand, will have a page showing all the equipment available for the tournament they are enrolled in, with options for rental, rental termination, and searching via a dedicated search bar. As previously mentioned, players can also leave reviews on the equipment provided. New players participating in a subsequent tournament by "admin X" will thus be able to read reviews left by players from previous tournaments organized by the same admin, as the equipment and its reviews are linked to the adminâ€™s profile.

Therefore, the application aims to accompany the user throughout the entire life of the tournament, from equipment rental to reviewing match outcomes.
